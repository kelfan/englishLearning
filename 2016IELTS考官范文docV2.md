`㊀背景` It is important for children to learn the difference between right and wrong at an early age. `㊁Argument` Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction. 
`㊂问题1：Y/N` To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? 
`㊃问题2：议论文`What sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behaviour to children? 
`背景转述㊀` One important stage in a child’s growth is certainly the development of a conscience, which is linked to the ability to tell right from wrong. `观点表达㊁㊂` This skill comes with time and good parenting `自己的观点+反驳了观点㊁`, and my firm conviction is that punishment does not have much of a role to play in this `表达作者观点也是文中主题句`. Therefore I have to disagree almost entirely with the given statement `回答To what extent`. `没有回答㊃`
`反驳观点㊁` To some extent the question depends on the age of the child. [分①]()To punish a very young child is both wrong and foolish, [解释①]()as an infant will not understand what is happening or why he or she is being punished. [分②]() Once the age of reason is reached however, a child can be rewarded for good behaviour and discouraged from bad. [解释②]()This kind but firm approach will achieve more than harsh punishments, which might entail many negative consequences unintended by the parents.
`弱化同意观点㊁` [承接 点①]() To help a child learn the difference between right and wrong, teachers and parents should firstly provide good role modelling in their own behaviour. [点②]() After that, if sanctions are needed, the punishment should not be of a physical nature, [解释②]() as that merely sends the message that it is acceptable for larger people to hit smaller ones – [effect②]() an outcome which may well result in the child starting to bully others. [强调②]() Nor should the punishment be in any way cruel.
`回答问题 ㊃` Rather, [点①]() teachers and parents can use a variety of methods to discipline their young charges, [例子①]() such as detention, withdrawal of privileges, and time-out. [点② further development]() Making the punishment fit the crime is a useful notion，[例子②]() which would see children being made to pick up rubbish they have dropped, clean up graffiti they have drawn, or apologize to someone they have hurt. [点③ 总结 强调]() In these ways responsibility is developed in the child, which leads to much better future behaviour than does punishment.

`㊀Background` Countries `Target` are becoming more and more similar `Topic` because people are able to buy the same products anywhere in the world.
`㊁Question:  Y/N ` Do you think this is a positive or negative `argument`  development `Topic` ?
`Paraphrase background` It is said that countries are becoming similar to each other because of the global spread of the same products, which are now available for purchase almost anywhere. `Author’s opinion` I strongly believe that this modern development is largely detrimental to culture and traditions worldwide.
`Positive point` A country’s history, language and ethos are all inextricably bound up in its manufactured artefacts. If the relentless advance of international brands into every corner of the world continues, these bland packages might one day completely oust the traditional objects of a nation, which would be a loss of richness and diversity in the world, as well as the sad disappearance of the manifestations of a place’s character. What would a Japanese tea ceremony be without its specially crafted teapot, or a Fijian kava ritual without its bowl made from a certain type of tree bark?
`Positive point` Let us not forget either that traditional products, whether these be medicines, cosmetics, toys, clothes, utensils or food, provide employment for local people. The spread of multinational products can often bring in its wake a loss of jobs, as people turn to buying the new brand, perhaps thinking it more glamorous than the one they are used to. This eventually puts old-school craftspeople out of work.
`Positive point` Finally, tourism numbers may also be affected, as travellers become disillusioned with finding every place just the same as the one they visited previously. To see the same products in shops the world over is boring, and does not impel visitors to open their wallets in the same way that trinkets or souvenirs unique to the particular area do.
`Negative point + conclusion` Some may argue that all people are entitled to have access to the same products, but I say that local objects suit local conditions best, and that faceless uniformity worldwide is an unwelcome and dreary prospect.

# Cambridge 10 Test B parenthood
`Background` Some parents buy their children a large number of toys `topic` to play with. 
`Question: exponent` What are the advantages and disadvantages for the child `target` of having a large number of toys? `No Argument` `No Keyword`
`Background` It is true that many parents purchase a multitude of playthings for their offspring. Whether or not this is a good thing for the child, is a moot point. `Author’s point` On the face of it the advantages seem most apparent, but could there be a downside to this phenomenon of devoted parenting as well?
`Negative point` Most people would consider children who have many toys to be the fortunate ones. Interesting things to play with stimulate many positives in the young boy or girl, such as optimum brain development, hand-eye coordination and colour recognition, apart from the simple joy of playing. Modern toys are designed to be educational as well as fun, and concerned parents carefully select products, which might speed their child’s acquisition of numbers or the alphabet.
`Positive point` Is it possible that owning multiple toys could be in any way detrimental to a child? This is an unusual question, but there are some hidden pitfalls. For one, wealthy parents might spoil their son or daughter by showering him/her with toys, resulting in a negative effect on the child’s character. For another, a growing child’s concentration span may suffer if they are constantly surrounded by too many tempting objects, so that they become unable to focus on any one game for a decent length of time before being distracted. On the social side, older children may become targets of envy from classmates, if they are perceived as having far more possessions than their peers. Finally, the majority of toys today are made of plastic which commonly contains the chemical BPA, proven to be dangerous for infants to suck on or ingest.
`Conclusion` It is clear then that this situation is not as straightforward as it first appears. It would seem that one of the many duties of parents is to make an informed choice about how many toys they buy for their young ones.

`Background` Some experts believe that it is better `keyword` for children `target` to begin learning a foreign language `topic` at primary school rather than secondary school. 
`Question: exponent` Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?  - Affect layout
`Background` Traditionally, children have begun studying foreign languages at secondary school, but introducing them earlier is recommended by some educationalists. This policy has been adopted by some educational authorities or individual schools, with both positive and negative outcomes. 
`Positive point` The obvious argument in its favour is that young children pick up languages much more easily than teenagers. Their brains are still programmed to acquire their mother tongue, which facilitates learning another language, and unlike adolescents, they are not inhibited by self-consciousness. 
`Positive point` The greater flexibility of the primary timetable allows for more frequent, shorter sessions and for a play-centred approach, thus maintaining learners' enthusiasm and progress. Their command of the language in later life will benefit from this early exposure, while learning other languages subsequently will be easier for them. They may also gain a better understanding of other cultures. 
`Negative point` There are, however, some disadvantages. Primary school teachers are generalists, and may not have the necessary language skills themselves. If specialists have to be brought in to deliver these sessions, the flexibility referred to above is diminished. If primary language teaching is not standardised, secondary schools could be faced with a great variety of levels in different languages within their intake, resulting in a classroom experience which undoes the earlier gains. There is no advantage if enthusiastic primary pupils become demotivated as soon as they change schools. However, these issues can be addressed strategically within the policy adopted.
`Conclusion` Anything which encourages language learning benefits society culturally and economically, and early exposure to language learning contributes to this. Young children’s innate abilities should be harnessed to make these benefits more achievable.

 
# Cambridge 9 Test 3
Some people say that the best `keyword` way to improve public health `Topic`  is by increasing the number of sports facilities `Argument ①`. Others, however, say that this would have little effect `Argument ②` on public health and that other measures are required `argument 3`.
`Question㊀` Discuss both these views and `Question ㊁` give your own opinion. 
`Target`: Sports facilities vs. other measures
`Topic` A problem of modern societies is the declining level of health in the general population, with conflicting views on how to tackle this worrying trend. `Introduce one argument` One possible solution is to provide more sports facilities to encourage a more active lifestyle. `Don’t need to write author’s opinion in the beginning`
`Argument ①` Advocates of this believe that today’s sedentary lifestyle and stressful working conditions mean that physical activity is no longer part of either our work or our leisure time. If there were easy-to-reach local sports centres, we would be more likely to make exercise a regular part of our lives, rather than just collapsing in front of a screen every evening. The variety of sports that could be offered would cater for all ages, levels of fitness and interests: those with painful memories of PE at school might be happier in the swimming pool than on the football pitch.  `Topic ⟼ assumption ⟼ explain ⟼ example`
`Argument ②` However, there may be better ways of tackling this problem. Interest in sport is not universal, and additional facilities might simply attract the already fit, not those who most need them. Physical activity could be encouraged relatively cheaply, for example by installing exercise equipment in parks, as my local council has done. This has the added benefit that parents and children often use them together just for fun, which develops a positive attitude to exercise at an early age. 
`Argument ③` As well as physical activity, high tax penalties could be imposed on high-fat food products, tobacco and alcohol, as excessive consumption of any of these contributes to poor health. Even improving public transport would help: it takes longer to walk to the bus stop than to the car.
`Question ㊁` In my opinion, focusing on sports facilities is too narrow an approach and would not have the desired results. People should be encouraged not only to be more physically active but also to adopt a healthier lifestyle in general.

Some people think that  the teenage years `argument ①` are the happiest times `topic` of most people's lives. Others think that adult life `argument ②` brings more happiness, in spite of greater responsibilities `key word`.
`Question ㊀` Discuss both these views and `Question ㊁` give your own opinion
`Target` teenage years vs. adult life
`Topic` What’s the happiest time in people’s lives: youth or old age; school, career or retirement? `Target` All of these have been suggested, but teenage years and adulthood both have many supporters.    
`Argument ①` Those who believe teenagers are the happiest people cite their lack of responsibilities as a significant factor. They are supported financially and emotionally by their parents, and although they may be included in family decisions, they’re not ultimately responsible. However, adolescents are on the threshold of adult life: they’re old enough to get a part-time job, so they can enjoy their first taste of financial independence, and their future study and career lie ahead. 
`Argument ①` Away from these serious concerns, young people have an active social life with their friends, often simply by hanging out with them. And of course, there’s the excitement of first love and first heartbreak. With all this to experience, teenagers see their parents’ lives as boring and stressful.     
`Argument ②` However, the reverse is also true. Adults see anxious, self-dramatising adolescents, and appreciate the joys of maturity. These may include a contented family life, long-lasting friendships and a career. Long-term relationships may not have the fireworks of adolescence, but are stronger for it, because of the wealth of shared experience. At work, many of us are challenged and stimulated by the increasing professional skills we acquire, which ensures that our jobs remain interesting.
`Argument ②` The greatest benefit, though, is that maturity gives you greater confidence in your own judgement, in all areas of life. You’re not afraid to express your opinion when others disagree and, unlike a teenager, you know when to let things go.   
`Question ㊁` Both these periods can be happy times, but I look back at my own teenage years with no desire to go back. Adult life may be less dramatic, but fireworks don’t keep you warm.

 
# Cambridge 8 Test 1
Some people think that `A1` parents should teach children how to be good members of society `topic`. Other, however, believe that `A2` school is the place to learn this.
`Q1` Discuss both views and `Q2` give your own opinion.
`Target` parents vs. school
`Topic` A child’s education has never been about learning information and basic skills. It has always included teaching the next generation how to be good members of society. `Target/argument 1` Therefore, this cannot be the responsibility of the parents alone.
`A1` In order to be a good member of any society the individual must respect and obey the rules of their community and share their values. Educating children to understand the need to obey rules and respect others always begins in the home and is widely thought to be the responsibility of parents. They will certainly be the first to help children learn what is important in life, how they are expected to behave and what role they will play in their world.
`A2` However, learning to understand and share the value system of a whole society cannot be achieved just in the home. Once a child goes to school, they are entering a wider community where teachers and peers will have just as much influence as their parents do at home. At school, children will experience working and living with people from a whole variety of backgrounds from the wider society. This experience should teach them how to cooperate with each other and how to contribute to the life of their community.
`Q2` But to be a valuable member of any community is not like learning a simple skill. It is something that an individual goes on learning throughout life and it is the response of every member of a society to take responsibility for helping the younger generation to become active and able members of that society.

Increasing the price of petrol is the best way `A1` to solve growing traffic pollution problems `Topic`.  
`Q1` To what extent do you agree or disagree?
`Q2` What other measures do you think might be effective?
`Target` traffic pollution
`Keyword` best
`Target` There is no doubt that traffic and pollution from vehicles have become huge problems, both in cities and on motorways everywhere. `Topic + Author’s opinion` Solving these problems is likely to need more than a simple rise in the price of petrol.
`Positive point` While it is undeniable that private car use is one of the main causes of the increase in traffic and pollution, higher fuel costs are unlikely to limit the number of drivers for long. As this policy would also affect the cost of public transport, it would be very unpopular with everyone who needs to travel on the roads. But there are various other measures that could be implemented that would have a huge effect on these problems.
`Q2` I think to tackle the problem of pollution, cleaner fuels need to be developed. The technology is already available to produce electric cars that would be both quieter and cleaner to use. Persuading manufacturers and travellers to adopt this new technology would be a more effective strategy for improving air quality, especially in cities.
`Q2` However, traffic congestion will not be solved by changing the type of private vehicle people can use. To do this, we need to improve the choice of public transport services available to travellers. For example, if sufficient sky trains and underground train systems were built and effectively maintained in our major cities, then traffic on the roads would be made dramatically reduced. Long-distance train and coach services should be made attractive and affordable alternatives to driving your own car for long journeys.
`Conclusion – Q2` In conclusion, I think that long-term traffic and pollution reductions would depend on educating the public to use public transport more, and on governments using public money to construct and run efficient systems. [286 words]() 
 
Cambridge 8 Test B
Some people think that it is better to educate boys and girls in separate schools. Others, however, believe that boys and girls benefit more from attending mixed schools. 
Discuss both these views and give your opinion.	
Some countries have single-sex education models, while in others both single sex and mixed schools co-exist and it is up to the parents or the children to decide which model is preferable.  
Some educationalists think it is more effective to educate boys and girls in single-sex schools because they believe this environment reduces distractions and encourages pupils to concentrate on their studies. This is probably true to some extent. It also allows more equality among pupils and gives more opportunity to all those at school to choose subjects more freely without gender prejudice. For example, a much higher proportion of girls study science to a high level when they attend girls schools than their counterparts in mixed schools do. Similarly, boys in single-sex schools are more likely to take cookery classes and to study languages, which are often thought of as traditional subjects for girls.  
On the other hand, some experts would argue that mixed schools prepare their pupils better for their future lives. Girls and boys learn to live and work together from an early age and are consequently not emotionally underdeveloped in their relations with the opposite sex. They are also able to learn from each other, and to experience different types of skill and talent than might be evident in a single gender environment. 
Personally, I think that there are advantages to both systems. I went to a mixed school, but feel that I myself missed the opportunity to specialise in science because it was seen as a natural domain and career path for boys when I was a girl. So because of that, I would have preferred to go to a girls school. But hopefully, times have changed and both genders of student can have equal chance to study what they want to in whichever type of school they attend.    （304 words）
 
Cambridge 7 Test 1
It is generally believed that some people are `A1` born with certain talents, for instance for sport or music, and others are not. However, it is sometimes claimed that any child `A2` can be taught to become a good sports person or musician.
`Q1` Discuss both views and `Q2` your own opinion. 
`Target` Child	 `Topic` Talents & Training
`Topic` The relative importance of natural talent and training is a frequent topic of discussion when people try to explain different levels of ability in, for example, sport, art or music.
`A2` Obviously, education systems are based on the belief that all children can effectively be taught to acquire different skills, including those associated with sport, art or music. So from our won school experience, we can find plenty of evidence to support the view that a child can acquire these skills with continued teaching and guided practice.
`A1` However, some people believe that innate talent is what differentiates a person who has been trained to play a sport or an instrument, from those who become good players. In other words, there is more to the skill than a good learned technique, and this extra talent cannot be taught, no matter how good the teacher or how frequently a child practices.
`Counter A2 + Author’s opinion` I personally think that some people do have talents that are probably inherited via their genes. Such talents can give individuals a facility for certain skills that allow them to excel, while more hard-working students never manage to reach a comparable level. But, as with all questions of nature versus nurture, they are not mutually exclusive. Good musicians or artists and exceptional sports stars have probably succeeded because of both good training and natural talent. Without the natural talent, continuous training would be neither attractive nor productive, and without the training, the children would not learn how to exploit and develop their talent.
`Conclusion` In conclusion, I agree that any child can be taught particular skills, but to be really good in areas such as music, art or sport, then some natural talent is required. [282words]() 
 
Cambridge 7 Test 3
`Background` At most people spend a major part of their adult life at work, `Topic` job satisfaction is an important element of individual wellbeing.
`Q1: exponent` What factors contribute to job satisfaction?
`Q2: exponent` How realistic is the expectation of job satisfaction for all workers?
`Target` 		`Keyword`
`Paraphrase Background: half sentence for one sentence` Nowadays many adults have full-time jobs and the proportion of their lives spent doing such jobs is very high. So feelings about one’s job must reflect how an individual feels about his or her life as whole, and because of this, job satisfaction is indeed very important for the wellbeing of that person.
`Q1` Employees get job satisfaction in a number of ways. Firstly, a person needs to feel that they are doing valued and valuable work, so positive feedback from superiors is very important in this respect. A sense of fulfilment is also encouraged if a worker feels the job is worth doing because it contributes to the society or the economy as a whole. Secondly, when someone feels they are improving or developing their skills through training opportunities, for example, then there is as sense of progression and purpose that rewards a worker. The sense of belonging to a team or a working community also contributes to job satisfaction because colleagues help each other to enjoy their working lives. Satisfaction is also increased by a sense of responsibility for and loyalty to a team.
`Q2` Of course not everyone enjoys their work. Hard economic realities mean that many people have little choice in the kind of job they can get. In some cases an employee is working in a job that suits neither their skills nor their personality. Some jobs are repetitive and boring, and labour relations may be poor and lead to resentment and insecurity rather than to job satisfaction.
`Author` However, even though it is unlikely that all workers do feel happy in their work, I think it is not unrealistic to promote more job satisfaction in any job. If the factors identified above are implemented, then any job can be improved and more workers can feel greater degrees of job satisfaction. [303words]() 
 
Cambridge 7 Test B
Some people feel that entertainers [e.g. film stars, pop musicians or sports stars]() are paid too much money. 
Do you agree or disagree? 
Which other types of job should be highly paid? 
I agree with the view that stars in the entertainment business are usually over paid. This is true whether we are considering stars of film, sport or popular music, and it often seems that the amount of money they are able to earn in as short time cannot possibly be justified by the amount of work they do.   
However, it is also true that it is only those who reach the very top of their profession who can get these huge salaries. So the size of salary that stars expect is closely linked to the competition they have to overcome in order to reach success. They are, in effect, rare talents.   
Furthermore, the majority of stars do not hold their top positions long. Sport stars and pop stars, for example, are soon replaced by the next younger, more energetic, generation, while the good looks of most film stars quickly fade. So this relatively short working life may be some justification for the very high pay.   
Unfortunately, professionals from other fields, who make a much greater contribution to human society, are paid so much less that it is hard to disagree with the statement. Teachers, nurses, laboratory researchers etc. are never listed among the best-paid professionals, yet they are more important to our well-being and our future than the stars who earn their fortunes so quickly.   
In conclusion, I think there may be some reasons why entertainment stars earn high salaries but overall I agree that they are overpaid. The gaps between their earnings and those of people who work less selfishly for the good of society cannot be justified. Such professionals should be much better appreciated and better paid.

Cambridge 6 Test 2
Successful sports professionals can `Topic` earn a great deal of more money than people in other important professionals. Some people think `A1` this is fully justified while others think `A2` it is unfair.
`Q1` Discuss both views and `Q2` your own opinion.
`Target` successful sports professionals vs. other important professionals		`Keyword` More
`Topic` As a result of constant media attention, sports professionals in my country have become stars and celebrities, and those at the top are paid huge salaries. Just like movie stars, they live extravagant lifestyles with huge houses and cars.
`Counter A2` Many people find their rewards unfair, especially when comparing these super salaries with those of top surgeons or research scientists, or even leading politicians who have the responsibility of governing the country. However, sports salaries are not determined by considering the contribution to society a person makes, or the level of responsibility he or she holds. Instead, they reflect the public popularity of sport in general and the level of public support that successful stars can generate. So the notion of ‘fairness’ is not the issue.
`A1` Those who feel that sports stars’ salaries are justified might argue that the number of professionals with real talent are very few, and the money is a recognition of the skills and dedication a person needs to be successful. Competition is constant and a player is tested every time they perform in their relatively short career. The pressure from the media is intense and there is little privacy out of the spotlight. So all of these factors may justify the huge earnings.
`Author` Personally, I think that the amount of money such sports stars make is more justified than the huge earnings of movie stars, but at the same time, it indicates that our society places more value on sport than on more essential professions and achievements. [251 words]() 
 
Cambridge 6 Test 4
Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and `A1` avoiding change. Others, however, think that `Topic` change is always `A2` a good thing.
`Q1` Discuss both views and `Q2` your own opinion. 
`Target`	`Keyword`
`Topic` Over the last half century the pace of change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. This has been driven by technological and scientific breakthroughs that are changing the whole way we view the world on an almost daily basis. This means that change is not always a personal option, but an inescapable fact of life, and we need to constantly adapt to keep pace with it.
`Counter A1` Those people who believe they have achieved some security by doing the same, familiar things are living in denial. Even when people believe they are resisting change themselves, they cannot stop the world around them from changing. Sooner or later they will find that the familiar jobs no longer exist, or that the ‘safe’ patterns of behaviour are no longer appropriate.
`Counter A2` However, reaching the conclusion that change is inevitable is not the same as assuming that ‘change is always for the better’. Unfortunately, it is not always the case that new things are promoted because they have good impacts for the majority of people. A lot of innovations are made with the aim of making money for a few. This is because it is the rich and powerful people in our society who are able to impose changes such as in working conditions or property developments that are in their own interests.
`Author` In conclusion, I would say that change can be stimulating and energizing for individuals when they pursue it themselves, but that all change, including that which is imposed on people, does not necessarily have good outcomes. [260words]()

Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on young children.  
Do you agree or disagree?    
I tend to agree that young children can be negatively affected by too much time spent on the computer every day. This is partly / primarily because sitting in front of a screen for too long can be damaging to both the eyes and the physical posture of young child, regardless of what they are using the computer for.    
However, the main concern is about the type of computer activities that attract children. These are often electronic games that tend to be very intense and rather violent. The player is usually the “hero” of the game and too much exposure can encourage children to be self-centered and insensitive to others.    
Even when children use a computer for other purposes, such as getting information or emailing friends, it is no substitute for human interaction. Spending time with other children and sharing non-virtual experiences is an important part of a children’s development that cannot be provided by a computer.    
In spite of this, the obvious benefits of computer skills for young children cannot be denied. Their adult world will be changing constantly in terms of technology and the Internet is the key to all the knowledge and information available in the world today. Therefore it is important that children learn at an early age to use the equipment enthusiastically and with confidence as they will need these skills throughout their studies and working lives.    
I think the main point is to make sure the young children do not overuse computers. Parents must ensure that their children learn to enjoy other kinds of activity and not simply sit at home, learning to live in a virtual world.

`Background` In some countries `Target` young people are encouraged to `Topic` work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies.
`Q1: Discuss` Discuss the `A1` advantages and `A2` disadvantages for young people to do this.	
`Keyword` 
`Background` It is quite common these days for young people in many countries to have a break from studying after graduating from high school. This trend is not restricted to rich students who have the money to travel, but is also evident among poorer students who choose to work and become economically independent for a period of time.
`A1` The reasons for this trend may involve the recognition that a young adult who passes directly from school to university is rather restricted in terms of general knowledge and experience of the world. By contrast, those who have spent some time earning a living or traveling to other places have a broader view of life and better personal resources to draw on. Furthermore, They tend to be more independent, which is a very important factor in academic study and research, as well as giving them an advantage in terms of coping with the challenges of student life.
`A2` However, there are certainly dangers/risks in taking time off at that important age. Young adults may end up never returning to their studies or finding it difficult to readapt to an academic environment. They may think that it is better to continue in a particular job, or to do something completely different from a university course. But overall, I think this is less likely today, when academic qualifications are essential for getting a reasonable career.
`Author` My view is that young people should be encouraged to broaden their horizons. That is the best way for them to get a clear perspective of what they are hoping to do with their lives and why. Students with such a perspective are usually the/tend to be the most effective and motivated ones and taking a year off may be the best way to gain this. [295 words]()

`Background` Research indicates that the characteristics we are `A1` born with have much `Keyword` more influence on our personality and development than `A2` any experiences we may have in our life.
`Q1: Opinion` What do you consider to be `Topic` the major influence?	
`Target` genetic factors nature vs. environment nurture
`Background` Today the way we consider human psychology and mental development is heavily influenced by the genetic sciences. We now understand the importance of inherited characteristics more than ever before. Yet we are still unable to decide whether an individual’s personality and development are more influenced by genetics factors nature or by the environment nurture.
`Counter A2` Research, relating to identical twins, has highlighted how significant inherited characteristics can be for an individual’s life. But whether these characteristics are able to develop within the personality of an individual surely depends on whether the circumstances allow such a development. It seems that the experiences we have in life are so unpredictable and so powerful, that they can boost or over-ride other influences, and there seems to be plenty of research findings to confirm this.
`Author` My own view is that there is no one major influence in a person’s life. Instead, the traits we inherit from our parents and the situations and experiences that we encounter in life are constantly interacting. It is the interaction of the two that shapes a person’s personality and dictates how that personality develops. If this were not true, then we would be able to predict the behaviour and character of a person from the moment they were born.
`Conclusion` In conclusion, I do not think that either nature or nurture is the major influence on a person, but that both have powerful effects. How these factors interact is still unknown today and they remain largely unpredictable in a person’s life. [250 words]()

Nowadays we are producing more and more rubbish.  
Why do you think this is happening?   
What can governments do to help reduce the amount of rubbish produced?    
I think it is true that in almost every country today each household and family produces a large amount of waste every week. Most of this rubbish comes from the packaging from the things we buy, such as processed food. But even if we buy fresh food without packaging, we still produce rubbish from the plastic bags used everywhere to carry shopping home.    
The reason why we have so much packaging is that we consume so much more on a daily basis than families did in the past. Convenience is also very important in modern life, so we buy packaged or canned food that can be transported from long distances and stored until we need it, first in the supermarket, and then at home.   
However, the amount of waste produced is also a result of our tendency to use something once and throw it away. We forget that even the cheapest plastic bag has used up valuable resources and energy to produce. We also forget that it is a source of pollution and difficult to dispose of.   
I think, therefore, that governments need to raise this awareness in the general public. Children can be educated about environmental issues at school, but adults need to take action. Governments can encourage such action by putting taxes on packaging, such as plastic bags, by providing recycling services and by fining households and shops that do not attempt to recycle their waste.   
With the political will, such measures could really reduce the amount of rubbish we produce. Certainly nobody wants to see our resources used up and our planet poisoned by waste.

`Background` Happiness `Topic` is considered to be very important in life.
`Q1 exponent` Why is it difficult to define?
`Q2 exponent` What factors are important in achieving happiness?
`Topic` Happiness is very difficult to define, because it means so many different things to different people. While some people link happiness to wealth and material success, others think it lies in emotions and loving personal relationships. Yet others think that spiritual paths, rather than either the material world or relationships with people, are the only way to true happiness.
`Q1` Because people interpret happiness for themselves in so many different ways, it is difficult to give any definition that is true for everyone. However, if there are different kinds of happiness for different individuals then the first step in achieving it would be to have a degree of self-knowledge. A person needs to know who he or she is before being able to know what it is that makes him or her happy.
`Q2` Of course, factor such as loving relationships, good health, the skills to earn a living and a peaceful environment all contribute to our happiness too. But this does not mean that people without these conditions cannot be happy.
`Q2 + author` Overall, I think an ability to keep clear perspectives in life is a more essential factor in achieving happiness. By that I mean an ability to have a clear sense of what is important in our lives [the welfare of our families, the quality of our relationships, making other people happy, etc.]() and what is not [a problem at work, getting annoyed about trivial things, etc.]().
`Conclusion` Like self-awareness, this is also very difficult to achieve, but I think these are the two factors that may be the most important for achieving happiness.

`BG` In many countries schools have `Topic` severe problems with student behaviour. 
`Q1 opinion` What do you think are the cause of this?
`Q2 opinion` What solutions can you suggest?
`BG + Author` Poor student behaviour seems to be increasingly widespread problem and I think that modern lifestyles are probably responsible for this.
`Q1` In many countries, the birth is decreasing so that families are smaller with fewer children. These children are often spoilt, not in terms of love and attention because working parents do not have the time for this, but in more material ways. They are allowed to have whatever they want, regardless of price, and to behave as they please. This means that the children grow up without consideration for others and without any understanding of where their standard of living comes from.
`Q1` When they get to school age they have not learnt any self-control or discipline. They have less respect for their teachers and refuse to obey school rules in the way that their parents did.
`Q2 + Author` Teachers continually complain about this problem and measures should be taken to combat the situation. But I think the solution to the problem lies with the families, who need to be more aware of the future consequences of spoiling their children. If they could raise them to be considerate of others and to be social, responsible individuals, the whole community would benefit.
`Q2` Perhaps parenting classes are needed to help them to do this, and high quality nursery schools could be established that would support families more in terms of raising the next generation. The government should fund this kind of parental support, because this is no longer a problem for individual families, but for society as a whole.

Cambridge 4 Test B
Some people believe that children should be allowed to stay at home and play until they are six or seven years old. Others believe that it is important for young children to go to school as soon as possible. 
What do you think are the advantages of attending school from a young age?
In many places today, children start primary school at around the age of six or seven. However, because it is more likely now that both parents work, there is little opportunity for children to stay in their own home up to that age. Instead, they will probably go to a nursery school when they are much younger.  
While some people think this may be damaging to a child’s development, or to a child’s relationship with their parents, in fact there are many advantages to having school experience at a young age.  
Firstly, a child will learn to interact with a lot of different people and some children learn to communicate very early because of this. They are generally more confident and independent than children who stay at home with their parents and who are not used to strangers or new situations. Such children find their first day at school at the age of six very frightening and this may have a negative effect on how they learn.   
Another advantage of going to school at an early age is that children develop faster socially. They make friends and learn how to get on with other children of a similar age. This is often not possible at home because they are the only children, or because their brothers or sisters are older or younger.   
So overall, I believe that, attending school from a young age is good for most children. They still spend plenty of time at home with their parents, so they can benefit from both environments. 

 
Cambridge 3 Test 3
In many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it as valuable work experience, important for learning and taking responsibility. 
What are your opinions on this?
The issue of children doing paid work is a complex and sensitive one.  It is difficult to say who has the right to judge whether children working is 'wrong' or 'valuable'. Opinions will also differ as to 'learning' benefits: no doubt teachers and factory owner, for example, would have varying concerns. 
An important consideration is the kind of work undertaken. Young children doing arduous and repetitive tasks on a factory production line, for example, are less likely to be 'learning' than older children helping in an old people's home.  There are health can safety issues to be considered as well.  It is an unfortunate fact that many employers may prefer to use the services of children simply to save money by paying them less than adults and it is this type of exploitation that should be discouraged. 
However, in many countries children work because their families need the additional income, no matter how small.  This was certainly the case in the past in many industrialized countries, and it is very difficult to judge that it is wrong for children today to contribute to the family income in this way. 
Nevertheless, in better economic circumstances, few parents would choose to send their children out to full-time paid work.  If learning responsibilities and work experience are considered to be important, then children can acquire these by having light, part-time paid work or even doing tasks such as helping their parents around the family home, which are unpaid, the undoubtedly of value in children's development.

 
Cambridge 3 Test 2
When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive.  
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?   
Overall, I disagree with the opinion expressed. I would like to begin by pointing out that “traditional skills and ways of life” are not automatically of one country, but of a culture or community.   
In many ways, the history of cultivation is the history of technology: from the discovery of fire to the invention of the wheel to the development of the Internet, we have been moving on from previous ways of doing things. Some technologies, such as weapons of mass destruction, are of negative impact. Others, such as medical advances, positively help people to live better or longer, and so very much help traditions ways of life. Surely, few people would seek to preserve such traditions as living in caves.   
Interestingly, technology can positively contribute to the keeping alive of traditional skills and ways of life. For example, the populations of some islands are too small to have normal schools. Rather than breaking up families by sending children to the mainland, education authorities have been able to use the Internet to deliver schooling online. In addition, the Internet, and modern refrigeration techniques, are being used to keep alive the traditional skills of production salmon, it can now be ordered from, and delivered to, anywhere in the world.   
In conclusion, without suggesting that all technology is necessarily good, I think it is by no means “pointless”, in any way, to try to keep traditions alive with technology. We should not ignore technology, because it can be our friend and support our way of life.

 
Cambridge 3 Test B	
Some people believe that children’s leisure activities must be educational; otherwise they are a complete waste of time.   
Do you agree or disagree？    
Today, education has become a priority for many parents seeking to secure a good future for their children in this rapidly changing world. They believe that if their children apply themselves and work hard at school, then they will increase their opportunities for going to higher education and eventually getting a good job. Of course they are right, and as access to the best education and best jobs is becoming more competitive, then it is true that children have to make the best of their study time when they young.   
However, the parents who do not allow their children sufficient free time for leisure activities outside school hours, are misguided. Such activities are far from being a waste of time for the children simply because they are not academic. It is important to remember that children need to develop skills other than intellectual ones, and the best way to do this is through activities such as sports, games and playing with other kids. If they cannot play make-believe games, how can they develop their imagination? How can they learn physical co-ordination or learn important social lessons about winning and losing if they do not practise any sports? Many children form strong, personal relationship with friends they play with, and without the opportunity to do this, they could grow up emotionally immature or unformed.   
Finally, I think it is also important to remember that children need to relax as well as work. If everything they do must have some educational or academic relevance, then they will soon get tired of studying altogether, which is the last thing parents would want. [255]()

 
Cambridge 2 Test 1
“Fatherhood ought to be emphasized as much as motherhood. The idea that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies leads on to the idea that they are also responsible for binging the children up.” 
To what extent do you agree or disagree.  
I believe that child-rearing should be the responsibility of both parents and that, whilst the roles within that partnership may be different, they are nevertheless equal in importance. In some societies, it has been made easier over the years for single parents to raise children on their own. However, this does not mean that the traditional family, with both parents providing emotional support and role-models for their children, is not the most satisfactory way of bringing up children. 
What is of crucial importance, in my opinion, is how we define “responsible for bringing the children up.” At its simplest, it could mean giving the financial support necessary to provide a home, food and clothes and making sure the child is safe and receives an adequate education. This would be the basic definition. 
There is, however, another possible way of defining that part of the quotation. That would say it is not just the father’s responsibility to provide the basics for his children, while his wife involves herself in the everyday activity of bringing them up. Rather, he should share those daily duties, spend as much time as his job allows within his children, play with them, read to them, help directly within their education, participate very fully in their lives and encourage them to share his.  
It is this second, fuller, concept of “fatherhood” that I am in favour of, although I also realize how difficult it is to achieve sometimes. The economic and development situation in many countries means that jobs are getting more, not less, stressful, requiring long hours and perhaps long journeys to work as well. Therefore it may remain for many a desirable ideal rather than an achievable reality.
 
Cambridge 2 Test 2
“Prevention is better than cure.”  
Out of a country’s health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures.  
To what extent do you agree of disagree with this statement?  
Of course it goes without saying that prevention is better than cure. That is why, in recent years, there has been a growing body of opinion in favour of putting more resources into health education and preventive measures. The argument is that ignorance of, for example, basic hygiene or the dangers of an unhealthy diet or lifestyle needs to be combated by special nationwide publicity campaigns, as well as longer-term health education.  
Obviously, there is a strong human argument for catching any medical condition as early as possible. There is also an economic argument for doing so. Statistics demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of treating a condition in early stages, rather than delaying until more expensive and prolonged treatment is necessary. Then there are social or economic costs, perhaps in terms of loss of earnings for the family concerned or unemployed benefit paid by the state.  
So far so good, but the difficulties start when we try to define what the “proportion” of the budget should be, particularly if the funds will be “diverted from treatment”. Decisions on exactly how much of the total health budget should be spent in this way are not a matter for the non-specialist, but should be made on the basis of an accepted health service model.  
This is the point at which real problems occur—the formulation of the model. How do we accurately measure which health education campaigns are effective in both medical and financial terms? How do we agree about the medical efficacy of various screening programs, for example, when the medical establishment itself does not agree? A very rigorous process of evaluation is called for, so that we can make informed decisions.
 
Cambridge 2 Test 4
The position of women in society has changed markedly in the last twenty years. Many of the problems young people now experience, such as juvenile delinquency, arise from the fact that many married women now work and are not at home to care for their children.  
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? 
It is certainly true that the position of women in society has undergone a dramatic change in the past twenty years but I do not feel that this is a direct cause of the indisputable increase in juvenile-related problems during this period. 
It is now accepted that young women should find work on leaving school; indeed to rely totally on their parents’ financial support is no longer an option in many families. Likewise, once they get married, the majority of women continue working since the financial pressures of setting up a house and establishing a reasonable of living often require two incomes.  
Twenty years ago it was common for women to give up work once they had children and devote their time to caring for their children. This is no longer the general rule and provision of professionally-run child care facilities and day nurseries have removed much of the responsibility for child rearing that used to fall to mothers. However, these facilities come at a cost and often require two salaries coming into a family to be afforded.
I do not believe that the increase in the number of working mothers has resulted in children being brought up less well than previously. Indeed it could be argued that by giving mothers the opportunity to work and earn extra money children can be better provided for than previously. There is more money for luxuries and holidays and a more secure family life is possible. Of course there are limits as to the amount of time that ideally should be spent away from home and the ideal scenario would be for one of the parents [often the wife]() to have a part-time job and thus be available for their children before and after school. It is important to establish the correct balance between family life and working life.


 
Cambridge 1 Test 1
News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in newspapers.  
What factors do you think influence these decisions? 
Do we become used to bad news? Would it be better if more good news was reported? 
It has often been said that “Good news is bad news”, because it does not sell newspapers. A radio station that once decided to present only good news soon found that it had gone out of business for lack of listeners. Bad news on the other hand is so common that in order to cope with it, we often simply ignore it. We have become immune to bad news and the newspapers and radio stations are aware of this. 
It is true that newspapers and TV stations mainly aim to report world events accurately, like the natural or human disasters, political events or the horrors of war. While it is also true that their main objective is to sell newspapers and attract listeners and viewers to their stations. For this reason TV and radio stations attempt to reflect the flavor of their station by providing news broadcasts tailor-made to suit their listeners’ preferences. Programs specializing in pop music or TV soap operas focus more on local news, home issues and up-to-date traffic reports. The more serious stations and newspapers like to provide “so called” objective news reports with editorial comments aimed at analyzing the situation. 
If it is true, then, that newspapers and TV stations are tailoring their news to their readers‟ and viewers‟ requirements, how can they possibly be reporting real world events in an honest and objective light? Many radio and TV stations do, in fact, report items of good news but they no longer call this news. They refer to these as human interest stories and package them in programs specializing, for instance, in consumer affairs or local issues. Good news now comes to us in the form of documentaries: the fight against children‟s cancer or AIDS, or the latest developments in the fight to save the planet from environmental pollution.

Cambridge 1 Test B
We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in businesses, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in the future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?
Computers are a relatively new invention. The first computers were built fifty years ago and it is only in the last thirty or so years that their influence has affected our everyday life. Personal computers were introduced as recently as the early eighties. In this short time they have made a tremendous impact on our lives. We are now so dependent on computers that it is hard to imagine what things would be like today without them. You have only got to go into a bank when their main computer is broken to appreciate the chaos that would occur if computers were suddenly removed world-wide.   
In the future computers will be used to create bigger and even sophisticated computers. The prospect for this are quite alarming. They will be so complex that no individual could hope to understand how they work. They will bring a lot of benefits but they will also increase the potential for unimaginable chaos. They will, for example, be able to fly planes and they will be able to co-ordinate the movements of several planes in the vicinity of an airport.  Providing all the computers are working correctly nothing can go wrong. If one small program fails----disaster.   
There is a certain inevitability that technology will progress and become increasingly complex. We should, however, ensure that we are still in a position where we are able to control technology. It will be all too easy to suddenly discover that technology is controlling us. By then it might be too late. I believe that it is very important to be suspicious of the benefits that computer will bring and to make sure that we never become totally dependent on a completely technological world.

Write about the following topic: Illiteracy has traditionally been viewed as largely a third world problem. However it is becoming apparent that in countries such as the USA and Australia, illiteracy is on the increase. Discuss possible causes for this and its effect on society.
Write at least 250 words. model answer: It is true that illiteracy is becoming a serious problem in industrialised nations. This is surprising as most people think that this is a problem only in under-developed nations such as in parts of Africa and India. Illiteracy is related to many other problems such as poverty, over-population and governmental corruption. Let us take a more detailed look at the causes of this growing problem in many Western nations.
One of the most obvious reasons for the increase in illiteracy is the advent of television. Children no longer have to read to obtain information. Neither do they have to read to relax. Today children get home from school and go straight to “the box” to watch their favorite program. Watching television is much easier and more exciting than reading.
Another reason for the increase in illiteracy is the fact that so many women work. This means that children are often alone at home and so they are unsupervised. When parents get home they are often too tired to spend quality time whit their children.
It is also true that many people blame schools for the decline in illiteracy. In many countries there has been a move away from teaching basic skills such as reading and writing.
There are many effects of this growing illiteracy rate. The most obvious is unemployment. This may in turn lead to alcohol and drug abuse. Ultimately the economy of the country begins to suffer and there is a drop in living standards.
To address this problem, parents need to become more aware of their responsibilities and schools need to consider a change in their teaching methods. If this worsening trend is not reversed, the problem of illiteracy will become very serious. [286 words]()

Write about the following topic: In some countries young people have little leisure time and are under a lot of pressure to work hard in their studies. What do you think are the causes of this? What solutions can you suggest? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words. model answer: Some young people find themselves with very little leisure time. I believe there are two main causes of this situation. The first is parental pressure and the second is competition for university places.
Every parent wants to see his or her child do well in school and go on to have a successful career. This means that they exert pressure on their children to spend hours each day studying at home. Some even arrange extra tuition for their children. In my own country, it is not uncommon for young people to spend another three hours at small private schools after their usual day at stale school is over. As a consequence, their leisure time is extremely limited and the pressure on them is considerable.
The second cause is related to the higher education system. Each year, there are many times more applicants to university than there are university places. The result of this is that only those students with very high grades manage to obtain a place. This contributes to the pressure on teenagers since they must work long hours to have any chance of success.
One solution to the problem is for parents to be made aware of the effects of the pressure they put on their children. Schools should inform parents that too much pressure can lead to anxiety, stress and depression. They should be shown ways in which they can help their children lead more balanced lives with a reasonable amount of leisure time.
Another effective measure would be for the government to invest in the creation of more university places. This could be done by expanding existing universities or by building new ones. This would have the effect of easing competition for places giving teenagers some of their precious free lime back. [296 words]()

Write about the following topic: Counties such as China, India and Japan have unsustainable population growths. In fact many experts are of the opinion that the population ‘explosion’ which is now a very worrying concern, is the most serious threat to life on this planet.
Give some suggestions to address this problem. Write at least 250 words. model answer: It is true that the population ‘explosion’ which has taken place over the last century, is a very serious problem. One of the main reasons for this unacceptable population growth is a lack of understanding about the environment. Over-population is the major reason for water, soil and air pollution. It is also often the cause of starvation and even wars. Experts have put forward many suggestions to address this problem. The following are just a few of these.
The most important weapon we have to fight population growth is education. This should start at a very early age i.e. before children even go to school. TV cartoons and children’s programs can be used to educate the very young. At high school level, students can be taught about the problem more directly. At university level, scholarships should be made available to students who wish to study further in this field. International exchange groups may also help to increase awareness.
Another important means of controlling population growth is to disadvantage people who have more than one or two children. This can be done, as it is in China, by means of a higher tax. Although it is controversial, persons who come forward to be sterilized could be given a sum of money. It may also be possible to make it advantageous for people to have only one child by giving such couples a special tax deduction.
It should also be possible to make contraception devices free to the public and easily obtainable.
This problem is a very difficult one to address but we should make every effort to do so. There are many other problems which are related to over-population such as increasing crime, illiteracy and pollution. So by addressing one problem we would be addressing the others as well. [298 words]()

Write about the following topic: In today’s competitive world, many families find it necessary for both parents to go out to work. While some say the children in these families benefit from the additional income, others feel they lack support because of their parents’ absence. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words. model answer: In the past a typical family consisted of a father who went out to work and a mother who stayed at home and looked after the children. Nowadays, it is the norm for both parents to work. This situation can affect children both positively and negatively.
Some people think that the children of working parents are in an advantageous position where their parents are able to afford mere luxuries such as new clothes, video games or mobile phones. Proponents of this view argue that children are able to enjoy and experience more from life due to their parents’ extra wealth, for example, by going on foreign holidays.
On the other hand, however, there are those who claim that when both parents work, their children do not get enough support and attention, meaning that the children might not do as well at school because there is no one at house to provide support with such things as homework or exam revision. The absence of a parent at home could make it easier for children to get involved in such things as drugs or undertake drinking.
When I was growing up, both my parents worked and I was always well provided for. On the other hand, I think that it would sometimes have been better if I could have seen more of my parents.
In conclusion, I believe that we cannot change the fact that both parents have to work nowadays. It is not an ideal situation, but if parents make time for their children in the evenings and at the weekends, then the children will not suffer in any way. It must be stated that the extra income generated by both parents working, makes for a much higher standard of living which benefits the whole family. [295 words]()

Write about the following topic: Successful sports professionals can earn a great deal more money than people in other important professions. Some people think this is fully justified while others think it is unfair.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words. model answer: As a result of constant media attention, sports professionals in my country have become stars and celebrities, and those at the top are paid huge salaries. Just like movie stars, they live extravagant lifestyles with huge houses and cars.
Many people find their rewards unfair, especially when comparing these super salaries with those of top surgeons or research scientists, or even leading politicians who have the responsibility of governing the country. However, sports salaries are not determined by considering the contribution to society a person makes, or the level of responsibility he or she holds. Instead, they reflect the public popularity of sport in general and the level of public support that successful stars can generate. So the notion of ‘fairness’ is not the issue.
Those who feel that sports stars’ salaries are justified might argue that the number of professionals with real talent are very few, and the money is a recognition of the skills and dedication a person needs to be successful. Competition is constant and a player is tested every time they perform in their relatively short career. The pressure from the media is intense and there is little privacy out of the spotlight. So all of these factors may justify the huge earnings.
Personally, I think that the amount of money such sports stars make is more justified than the huge earnings of movie stars, but at the same time, it indicates that our society places more value on sport than on more essential professions and achievements. [251 words]()

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words. model answer: New factories often bring many good things to a community, such as jobs and increased prosperity. However, in my opinion, the benefits of having a factory are outweighed by the risks. That is why I oppose the plan to build a factory near my community.
I believe that this city would be harmed by a large factory. In particular, a factory would destroy the quality of the air and water in town. Factories bring smog and pollution. In the long run, the environment will be hurt and people’s health will be affected. Having a factory is not worth that rise.
Of course, more jobs will be created by the factory. Our population will grow. To accommodate more workers, more homes and stores will be needed. Do we really want this much growth, so fast? If our town is going in growth, I would prefer slow growth with good planning. I don’t want to see rows of cheaply constructed townhouses. Our quality of life must be considered.
I believe that this growth will change our city too much. I love my hometown because it is a safe, small town. It is also easy to travel here. If we must expand to hold new citizens, the small-town feel will be gone. I mould miss that greatly.
A factory would be helpful in some ways. However, I feel that the dangers are greater than the benefits. I cannot support a plan to build a factory here, and hope that others feel the same way. [251 words]()

Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words. model answer: If I could change one thing about my hometown, I think it would be the fact that there’s no sense of community here. People don’t feel connected, they don’t look out for each other, and they don’t get to know their neighbors.
People come and go a lot here. They change jobs frequently and move on. This means that they don’t put down roots in the community. They don’t join community organizations and they’re not willing to get involved in trying to improve the quality of life. If someone has a petition to put in a new street light, she has a very hard time getting a lot of people to sign. They don’t feel it has anything to do with them. They don’t get involved in improving the schools because they don’t think the quality of education is important to their lives. They don’t see the connection between themselves and the rest of their community.
People don’t try to support others around them. They don’t keep a friendly eye on their children, or check in on older folks if they don’t see them for a few days. They’re not aware when people around them may be going through a hard time. For example, they may not know if a neighbor loses a loved one. There’s not a lot of community support for individuals.
Neighbors don’t get to know each other. Again, this is because people come and go within a few years. So when neighbors go on vacation, no one is keeping an eye on their house. No one is making sure nothing suspicious is going on there, like lights in the middle of the night. When neighbors’ children are cutting across someone’s lawn on their bikes, there’s no friendly way of casually mentioning the problem. People immediately act as if it’s a major property disagreement.
My hometown is a nice place to live in many ways, but it would be much nice if we had that sense of community. [331 words]()
