The Royal Swedish Academy of Science in Physics award professors for having direct observation of gravitational waves, which were predicted by Einstein in a hundred years ago, in the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory as a remarkable achievement.

[Sandra Goutte et al., Evidence of auditory insensitivity to vocalization frequencies in two frogs]
Goutte, an evolutionary biologist and herpetologist, discovered that a piece of forg - pumpkin toadlet, is unable to hear the voice made by itself through tracing electrical impulses or even dissections when playing recordings of the calls to the frogs. 

# Wetlands Could Save Cities--and Money, Too
https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/wetlands-could-save-cities-and-money-too/
Apart from the intrinsic beauty and the importance of nature of wetlands, the benefits of wetlands could be the reduction of impacts of storms and its economic benefits. For the impacts of storms, wetlands act as a barrier to reduce storm surge or a sponge to soak up the waters. These functions could cut flood damages by 16 percent as identified by researchers, which could put a price-tag of the economic benefit of wetlands. Therefore we should continue to conserve wetlands.

# Feds Want to Know Who's Protesting Trump

Law enforcement in U.S. requested the company DreamHost to turn over relevant information about DisruptJ20, which Web site has engaged in organizing protests against the Trump administration. This leads to people's concerns in government's prosecution of someone through using DreamHost's data.

# Cannibalism Quells Contagion Among Caterpillars
https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/cannibalism-quells-contagion-among-caterpillars/
There are some advantages of cannibalism within caterpillars. At first, it is an esay-to-process meal to eat the same species which have all the nutrients required. Throughing this way, the competition within the same area can be reduced. Moreover, the infected individuals also could be removed by canibalism, which leads to the caterpillar population to wind up up healthier.

# Winking Star 6 Centuries Ago Explained

An astronomer - Michael Shara puzzled over the novalike fireworks exploded in the Milky Way each year like solving a jigsaw puzzle. He and his colleagues explained that the reason for the star to be seen within 14 days and to disappeared after that is that the white dwarf within the binary star system suck hydrogen off of the hydrogen-rich start within the same system, which leads to a thermonuclear event like a gigantic hydrogen bomb to be observed by astronomers.

# Rising CO2 Pushes Plants To Drink Sparingly

[Ralph F. Keeling et al, Atmospheric evidence for a global secular increase in carbon isotopic discrimination of land photosynthesis]
If the level of CO2 rise, plants will use water more efficient, which means plants will release less water in the process of photosynthesis. The volumne of efficiency improvement was proved by a geochemist, Ralph Keeling, and his colleagues by calculating the ratio between the isotope carbon-13 and its lighter and much more prevalent cousin, carbon-12. 

# Warming Puts Squeeze on Ancient Trees

 [Brian V. Smithers et al, Leap-frog in slow-motion: divergent responses of tree species and life stages to climatic warming in Great Basin sub-alpine forests]
Climate change changes the treeline of trees because the increase of temperature allow trees like limber pines can live in the place where bristlecone pines are living.
